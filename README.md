# Certificates

This repository works as a database for my certificates. Even though most of them are not worth mentioning anywhere else, they are, in my opinion, at least worth keeping, since they show many hours, sometimes even days of work and study. I divided them into 3 separate categories.

# Certifications

These a professional certifications, that require many hours of study and dedication to a subject. Passing an exam like CompTIA or eJPT.

# Certificates

These are course certificates, awarded after completing a learning path or just a simple course.

# Workshops

Certificates I get from attending workshops. Simple as that.
